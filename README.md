# Simulation of the destruction of bubbles with no surfactant at the gas-liquid interface

 Create gas-liquid coexistence conditions (ρ(G) < ρ < ρ(L))

→  Create states of density ρ(L) (and ρ(G)), and attach together

→  Hollow out of the liquid phase to make a bubble

→  Gravity on atoms


## Prevention of parallel shift caused by gravity

 Create a wall that does not move with the atoms named number 2
